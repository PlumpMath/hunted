Hunted!
=======
- Avoid and/or destroy your foes until they swarm and overwhelm you despite your immense dogfighting prowess.
- Controls:
	- **left,right,up,down** arrows to maneuver
	- **space** to fire
	- **shift** to boost

Why?
----
- Because making a crappy game is as fun as playing a good one.
- To try my hand at javascript.
- To get some experience with git & github.
- To fight my tendency to be overly precious and never release stuff.

Dependencies
------------
- Grant Skinner's Easel.js to ease me into JS with some handy AS-like objects and a much needed display list for canvas.
- Underscore.js b/c it is handy, and Backbone.js for its Event system.
- jQuery hotkeys plugin (slightly modified to fit my purposes) for reliable keyboard input.
