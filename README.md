Hunted
======
- Avoid and/or destroy your foes until they swarm and overwhelm you despite your immense dogfighting prowess.
- Controls:
	- **left,right,up,down** arrows to maneuver
	- **space** to fire pee sword
	- **s** to fire seeker
	- **shift** to boost

Why?
----
- Because making a crappy game more fun than playing a good one.
- I am a JS noob and want to get my code reviewed by others who know what they are doing.

Dependencies
------------
- Grant Skinner's Easel.js to ease me into JS with some handy AS-like objects and a much needed display list for canvas.
- Underscore.js b/c it is mighty handy.
- jQuery hotkeys plugin (slightly modified to fit my purposes) for reliable keyboard input.
