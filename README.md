Hunted!
=======

Why?
----
- Because making a crappy game is as fun as playing a good one.
- To try my hand at JS.
- To get some experience with git & github.
- To fight a tendency to be overly precious and never release stuff.
- For the sake of fun/useless code joy.
- So that any JS savvy folks out there can laugh at what I am doing wrong and help straighten me out.

How?
----
- Using Grant Skinner's Easel.js to ease me into JS with some handy AS-like objects; thanks Grant & Posse.
- Using Underscore.js b/c it is very handy, and Backbone.js for its Event system; thanks J.Ashkenas.
- Using jQuery.hotkeys to try and get something that resembles cross-platform kb input; thanks J.Resig & Tzury Bar Yochay.

What?
-----
- A simple shootemup game where you avoid and/or destroy foes until they swarm and overwhelm you despite your dogfighting prowess.
- Use the **left,right,up,down arrows** to fly, **space** to shoot, and **shift** to boost.
